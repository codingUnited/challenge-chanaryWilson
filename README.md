Welcome to my CodingUnited challenge repo! ✨ This challenge is to test our abilities to work with **Git versioning** control system for collaborative purposes.
## Setup Instructions
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codingUnited/challenge-chanaryWilson.git
cd challenge-chanaryWilson
```
## Explanation for `.gitignore`
The `.gitignore` file is useful for data that needs to be kept secret or untracked. For example, say you had a `.env` file that held secret keys, passwords, etc. Since this file holds private and local information, it must be untracked and not pushed into GitHub, otherwise, there is a risk of exposure. It is also useful for local instances of logs, tests, databases, modules and the like.
## Coming Soon!
* Styling and customizations (CSS, etc.)
* GitHub Pages for live link
